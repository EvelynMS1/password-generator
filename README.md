# Password Generator

## Description
 
  Motivation behind building this project was to ensure the security for individuals by generating a random password with the control and option for users to include a variation of characters including upper/lowercase, special characters and numerical character within a password. I built this project in order to expand my knowledge by putting to use conditionals and while loops as well as using javascript methods which provided interactivness for the user. By facilitating the user to input certain values and depending on the users input apply their values to customize and personalize their response creating a more useful satisfying experience. Besides creating a more enjoyable user experience this project solves the problem that individuals may face when wanting a password to secure their account on the web, thus ensuring that a random password is created and equally complex providing an accessible efficient option for the user when creating a password for personal use, by answering a few questions. I learned how to overcome challenges throughout the process of creating this project such as logical errors in features. As well as fixing functions that needed to be improved in order to run effectively. Equally important was that of becoming more accustom to testing and debugging throughout the building process to ensure that the path that I was currently following was the best course to take. This further helped with questioning the logic of my program leading me to ask questions and research these questions which would further aid me in producing a clearer logic within my program understanding each part of my code and how it worked together.
